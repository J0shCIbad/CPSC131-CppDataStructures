# Part1
Instructions available in the pdf

Provide:
- GroceryItem.cpp - Can use previous work and/or update it
- GroceryList.cpp - Start with file provided, make changes in designated TO-DO areas only
- output.txt - capture your program's output to this file (./filename > output.txt)
- Note: Redirecting a program's output was explained in a link on Part0's instruction page; it is also explained here: https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-redirect-command-output-to-a-file-2618084 
(The redirection operator we work with related to pointers is a separate concept than when it is used here to refer to the console)

When ready for testing, move the contents of the testing folder into your working directory. I do not care if this is reflected in your repository or not, they are simply available for your use.
